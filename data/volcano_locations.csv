Individual vents spread across a broad NW-SE-trending area extending about 50 km from the towns of Ormont on the NW to Bad Bertrich on the SE. Eruptions originated from a mantle plume through Devonian sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Two-thirds of the volcanic centers in the field are scoria cones; lava flows have been produced from about half of them. About 30% of the centers are maars or tuff rings, many of which are occupied by lakes. About 230 eruptions have occurred during the past 730,000 years.

The high point on the island, Monte Epomeo, is a volcanic horst composed of the Green Tuff ignimbrite deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least 800 m of uplift has formed as a result of resurgent doming during past 33,000 years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows, and a major collapse of Mount Epomeo produced a large submarine debris-avalanche deposit.

Oswald (1906) noted that steep escarpments of Nummulitic limestones faced the Dalykh-tapa volcano, about 6 km NE across an extensive lava-flow field.

The cones are well-formed, but covered with thick soils and vegetation; they are thought to have been inactive for hundreds or thousands of years (Wheller, 1986). The Tapak and Lesong cones are not covered by deposits of the youngest dacitic pumice eruptions of nearby Batur volcano, and are thus thought to be less than 23,000 years old.

The summit lava dome was emplaced during the 1361 eruption, and the last magmatic eruption took place in 1773 CE.

The volcano is uniquely offset west of the NE-trending alignment of volcanoes in the Katmai area.  The broad, 2317-m-high stratovolcano, formerly known as Knife Peak, consists of a late-Pleistocene volcano with glacial valleys on the north that was truncated on its SW side by an early Holocene edifice collapse.  A Holocene volcano was subsequently constructed within the 1.5-km-wide scarp left by the emplacement of a large SW-flank debris avalanche.  Nested cones with three concentric craters mostly fill the scarp, and thick, blocky lava flows blanket the SW flanks of the volcano below the collapse scarp.  In contrast to the more silicic centers of the Katmai area along the crest of the range, lava flows from Griggs are dominantly andesitic in composition, and dacitic lava flows are uncommon.  No historical eruptions have occurred from Griggs, but noisy fumarolic jets near the summit can be heard from the valley floor, 1750 m below.

The crater itself lies on the SW margin of a larger 2.2-km-wide Somma crater, which is breached widely to the SW as a result of slope failure. Frequent explosive eruptions since about 4300 years ago produced pyroclastic deposits of the Yellow Tephra Formation, which blanket much of the island. The first historical eruption took place in 1718; it and the 1812 eruption produced major explosions. Much of the northern end of the island was devastated by a major eruption in 1902 that coincided with the catastrophic Mont Pelée eruption on Martinique. A lava dome was emplaced in the summit crater in 1971 during a strictly effusive eruption, forming an island in a lake that filled the crater prior to an eruption in 1979. The lake was then largely ejected during a series of explosive eruptions, and the dome was replaced with another.","West Indies","West Indies","13.330","-61.180","1220","Subduction zone / Oceanic crust (< 15 km)","Holocene","Eruption Observed","https://volcano.si.edu/gallery/photos/GVP-05130.jpg","Soufrière St. Vincent volcano forms the northern end of the island of St. Vincent.

Prior to the 1939 eruption, which was witnessed by a large number of people in northern Grenada, there had been no written mention of the volcano.

Controversy surrounds the formation of the dramatic 10 x 17 km Las Cañadas caldera, which is partially filled by Teide stratovolcano, the highest peak in the Atlantic Ocean. The origin of the caldera has been variably considered to be due to collapse following multiple major explosive eruptions or as a result of a massive landslide (in a manner similar to the earlier formation of the massive La Orotava and Guimar valleys), or a combination of the two processes. The most recent stage of activity beginning in the late Pleistocene included the construction of the Pico Viejo and Teide edifices.

The lavas on Tanggamus are vesicular and porphyritic, and at about 1.4 million years old, are younger than the pyroclastic breccias and ignimbrites.

Based on K-Ar ages (Nakano et al., 2001; Sudo et al., 1998) and the local geology, the eruptive history is divided into four stages: 1 (1.1-0.85 Ma): the most voluminous eruptive phase, with activity concentrated at the center of the field; 2 (0.85-0.7 Ma): after a possible volcanic hiatus between 0.95 and 0.76 Ma, activity resumes in the center of the field; 3 (0.7-0.56 Ma): volcanic activity expands to the adjacent eastern and western islands; 4 (0.56-0.3 Ma): volcanic activity continues but at a lower intensity (Sudo et al., 1998). Volcanism in this field is likely a result of a mantle diapir (Sudo et al., 1998).

The initial fissure eruptions produced trachybasaltic lava flows 15-17 km long that covered an area of 100 km2. The most recent eruptions were considered by the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Vlodavetz and Piip, 1959) to have occurred between about 1300 and 1700 CE from Aniusk (Monni) cone, based on morphological evidence. Later work (Ignatiev, 1994) showed that Monni volcano was partially destroyed by glaciers and phreatic explosions produced by glacial meltwater flowing into the vent. Lava flows from Maly Anyuy volcano flowed onto glacial ice, and explosions induced by glacial meltwater destroyed the cone. The Monni lava flows dammed up drainages, forming lakes. During an early Holocene period of warming, large creeks overflowed from these lakes and deposited fluvial materials. The cone and lava flow are located between the Maly Anyuy and Bolshoy Anyuy rivers, about 75 km SSE of the community of Keperveyem.","Kamchatka and Mainland Asia","Russia (northeastern)","67.154","165.820","1560",NA,"Pleistocene",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"165.82,67.154","Pleistocene"

This volcanism is generally characterized by thick lava flows and volcaniclastic deposits. The entire volcanic field is up to 1500 m thick. Volcanic activity in the Gaeta Bay and surrounding regions was largely fault bounded, where extension and subsidence controlled the emplacement and displacement of most of the volcanic centers (Torrente and Milia, 2013). These volcanic centers developed between 0.4 and 0.1 Ma. The oldest volcanic center is lower Pleistocene. The extension and volcanism responsible for the volcanic field migrated eastward with time, towards the Campi Flegrei (Torrente and Milia, 2013).

Both the domes and the flows are intruded by a few rhyodacite and andesitic dikes that appear to originate from a rhyodacite dome near the center of the complex.
