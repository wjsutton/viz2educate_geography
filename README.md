### :a: About

Viz2educate focuses on creating a high-quality bank of educational resources for teachers worldwide. Teachers will have free access to dig into subject-related visualizations.

Our Goal:

Use Social Media and Data Visualization to:

- Create an online gallery of educational resources for teachers and students globally.
- Create visualizations that do not only help teachers with access to unlimited resources, but also instigate the next generation toward data visualization.
- Our gallery will be a one-stop-shop for subjects like geography, history, science, etc. The visualizations will be based on a curated global syllabus post discussion with teachers from around the globe.

This month's theme is Geography, and from reviewing the [AQA Geography Specification](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/geography/specifications/AQA-8035-SP-2016.PDF) I've come up with three dataviz ideas to test:

- Volcanoes, Data from Smithsonian Institution [https://volcano.si.edu/database/webservices.cfm](https://volcano.si.edu/database/webservices.cfm)
- Deforestation, Data from Global Forest Watch [https://data.globalforestwatch.org/](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/)
- Earthquakes, Data from IRIS [http://ds.iris.edu/seismon/index.phtml](http://ds.iris.edu/seismon/index.phtml)
